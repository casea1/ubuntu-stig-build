# ubuntu-stig-build

Ansible-pull project that STIG-hardens a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 LTS install in a single run — all
while the machine still has internet, before it is moved to an air-gapped network. It ships **two
deployment profiles**, selected by `deployment_profile` (default `development`). Both can run on
headless server hardware:

- **`development`** — a **DoD-STIG-hardened engineering workstation**: installs the dev toolchain,
  a **GNOME desktop + xrdp** so users **RDP in for a full GUI** (it installs the GUI, so a server
  base works too), then hardens with **Canonical's Ubuntu Security Guide** (`usg fix disa_stig`)
  plus a small `desktop_hardening` role that re-asserts the GUI/RDP and adds the GNOME/GDM and USB
  carve-outs USG doesn't cover. `usg audit` is the compliance report. Needs an **Ubuntu Pro** token.
- **`ai`** — turns a **Ubuntu Pro 24.04 Server** into a hardened **host for a local-AI inference
  stack**: installs **Docker + the NVIDIA GPU stack**, hardens with the same **USG**
  (`usg fix disa_stig`), and **opens the inbound ports** your containers need. You deploy the AI
  tools (vLLM / Open WebUI / pgvector / Docling) from your **own prebuilt images + compose files** —
  Ansible does host prep, not container management. See **[the `ai` server profile](#ai-server-profile)**.

> **Both profiles now harden with Canonical's USG** (they need an Ubuntu Pro token), not the
> community ansible-lockdown role. The first release named the profiles `desktop`/`server` and used
> ansible-lockdown + an OpenSCAP scan on the desktop; those names are still accepted as aliases.

You install Ubuntu, run one command, reboot, and collect the report.

## What it does

The work is split into Ansible roles that run in a **deliberate order** —
install → configure → dev tools → harden → scan. Order matters: hardening tightens `umask`, sets
`noexec` on `/tmp`, and locks down PAM, which breaks package/pip installs if it runs first; and the
compliance content must be downloaded while the box is still online.

| Stage | Role | What it does |
|-------|------|--------------|
| 1. Install | `base_packages` | Core tooling (below) |
| 2. Configure | `app_config` | Service config + access controls |
| 3. Accounts | `local_accounts` | Org users/groups, ACL'd shared folders, USB→`dta` policy |
| 4. Dev tools | `dev_tools` | Compilers, Python env, VS Code extensions |
| 5. Harden | `usg_harden` + `desktop_hardening` | USG `usg fix disa_stig`, then GUI/GNOME/USB re-assert |
| 6. Branding | `desktop_branding` | System-wide wallpaper (desktop + lock screen) |
| 7. Report | `usg audit` (in `usg_harden`) | Compliance report → `/var/log/stig-scan` |

> **Hardening switched to Canonical USG for both profiles.** The `development` pipeline used to run
> the `ansible-lockdown/UBUNTU24-STIG` role + SSG gap-remediation task files + an OpenSCAP scan; it
> now runs `usg_harden` (USG) followed by `desktop_hardening` (the GNOME/GDM/USB carve-outs USG
> doesn't do, plus a GUI/firewall re-assert). The stage descriptions below marked *(legacy)* describe
> the old lockdown flow and are kept for historical context.

### 1. `base_packages` — core tooling
- **Security/scan:** ClamAV (daemon + freshclam), OpenSCAP (`oscap`), OpenSSH client
- **Network/analysis:** Wireshark + `tshark`, PuTTY (GUI) + `putty-tools` (`plink`/`pscp`/`psftp`)
- **Languages/editors:** Python 3.12, your editor (VS Code by default; `vim`/`neovim` selectable), Git
- **PowerShell 7.4.16 LTS** (`pwsh`) — required by the PowerStrux auditing tool; pinned `.deb`
- **Network provisioning services** — `tftpd-hpa`, `isc-dhcp-server`, `dnsmasq`, installed but
  left **disabled + stopped** (enable deliberately once configured for your network)

### 2. `app_config` — service config + access controls
- Starts the ClamAV daemon + freshclam definition updates + a weekly scan timer
- Restricts packet capture to a `wireshark` group and locks down `dumpcap` (STIG requirement)

### 3. `local_accounts` — org users, groups & access control
- Creates the access groups **`dta`** (USB storage), **`audit`** (owns `/opt/_AuditFiles`),
  **`sentry`** (owns `/home/shared`) and the standing user accounts (defined in `group_vars`),
  each created with a **locked password** — set per-machine at deploy with `sudo passwd <user>`
- Group-shared folders use setgid **+ POSIX default ACLs** so group sharing survives the STIG
  `umask 077` (which would otherwise make new files `0600`)
- **Restricts USB storage to the `dta` group** (udisks2 polkit + udev rule) — out of the box USB
  was only de-auto-mounted, not access-controlled. See
  [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md#local-accounts-access-groups--branding)

### 4. `dev_tools` — engineering workstation layer
- **Toolchains:** `build-essential` (gcc/g++/make), `gdb`, `cmake`, GNAT (Ada), .NET SDK 8.0,
  Docker engine, Doxygen/Graphviz, a JRE (for UMLet)
- **Shared Python environment** at `/opt/eng-venv` with ~140 libraries (data science +
  network automation: NumPy/Pandas/SciPy/JupyterLab/Flask, NAPALM/Netmiko/Scapy/ncclient/
  junos-eznc, …). Exposed as a system-wide Jupyter kernel **"Eng (Python 3.12)"** and an
  `eng` shell command. Users don't need to know the path — VS Code and Jupyter are pre-wired.
- **26 VS Code extensions** (C/C++, C#/.NET, CMake, Python/Pylance, Ada & SPARK, GitLens,
  Docker, Remote-SSH, …) installed and seeded into `/etc/skel` so any account inherits them
- Adds the primary user to the `docker` group

### 5. `usg_harden` + `desktop_hardening` — hardening (current)
- **`usg_harden`** attaches the box to **Ubuntu Pro** (token supplied out-of-band) and runs
  **`usg fix disa_stig`** — Canonical's officially-supported DISA-STIG remediation — then
  **`usg audit`** writes the compliance report to `/var/log/stig-scan/`. Guarded so it won't lock
  you out (self-skips with no token; refuses `usg fix` unless an admin has a usable password;
  stamped to run once per image).
- **`desktop_hardening`** runs **after** USG and does only what USG doesn't: re-asserts the
  graphical target / GDM / xrdp and the SSH+RDP firewall openings, sets the **GDM DCSA banner** and
  the **GNOME dconf** screensaver/automount/Ctrl-Alt-Del locks, and re-enables `usb-storage` for the
  `dta` carve-out (the STIG blacklists it).
- Runs on the `development` profile; the `ai` profile runs `usg_harden` only.

### 5b. `stig_harden` — hardening *(legacy, no longer used)*
- Imports the **UBUNTU24-STIG** Lockdown role (pinned to **v1.3.0**), applying **CAT I + II**
  (CAT III off by default; `disruption_high` off so the most breaking controls are skipped)
- Adds the GNOME/GDM pieces the *server* STIG omits: the **DCSA login banner**, idle screen lock,
  screensaver concealment, and disabling the Ctrl-Alt-Del logout key
- **Closes the SSG/ComplianceAsCode `stig`-profile findings the Lockdown role skips** with a
  set of idempotent, desktop-safe gap-remediation task files (`tasks/audit|pam|sessions|gnome|
  ssh|services|filesystem|grub.yml`): full auditd rule set, PAM faillock, session limits, GNOME
  dconf locks, sshd, chrony/ufw/AIDE, file/journal perms, and the GRUB2 bootloader password.
  See [STIG gap remediation](OPERATIONS.md#stig-gap-remediation-ssg-scan-findings) for the
  coverage table and the **POA&M list** (FIPS, smartcard, disk encryption, …).
- Works around three upstream bugs in the role's GNOME dconf controls (see
  [Known issues & exceptions](#known-issues--exceptions))

### 6. `desktop_branding` — system-wide wallpaper
- Deploys `SHB_Background.jpg` to `/usr/share/backgrounds/` and sets it **locked, system-wide** on
  the desktop background and the **session lock screen** — the lock-screen part overrides the STIG
  blank-screensaver control (documented deviation). GDM login background is best-effort (Ubuntu's
  greeter usually ignores it).

### 7. Compliance report — `usg audit` (current)
- The report now comes from **`usg audit disa_stig`** (run inside `usg_harden`), which writes its
  HTML + XCCDF results to `/var/log/stig-scan/`. The standalone OpenSCAP scan below is **no longer
  run** (the `scap_scan` role remains in the repo but is not in the pipeline).

### 7b. `scap_scan` — compliance report *(legacy, no longer used)*
- Fetches the **Ubuntu 24.04 SCAP Security Guide datastream** from SSG release **v0.1.81**
  (checksum-verified) — the distro's `ssg-debderived` package only ships content through 22.04
- Runs `oscap` against the DISA STIG profile and writes, to `/var/log/stig-scan/`:
  - `stig-report-<date>.html` — human-readable report
  - `stig-viewer-<date>.xml` — importable into DISA STIG Viewer
  - `stig-arf-<date>.xml` — full ARF results

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** a freshly installed Ubuntu 24.04.4 Desktop with internet access, and a local
account whose name matches `dev_tools_user`/`wireshark_users` in `group_vars/all.yml`
(default `austin_case_adm`).

On the target machine, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casea1/ubuntu-stig-build/main/bootstrap.sh | sudo bash
```

It first **prompts (hidden) for the disk encryption password** to enable TPM auto-unlock (type it, or
press Enter to skip), then installs Ansible + the Lockdown role and runs the full pipeline as a detached
systemd unit named `stig-build` (detached so the GDM restart during hardening can't kill it). Watch it:

```bash
journalctl -u stig-build -f
systemctl status stig-build        # active (exited) = success
```

When it finishes, **collect the reports from `/var/log/stig-scan/` while still online**, then
reboot. The machine comes up to a graphical login showing the DCSA banner.

**New to this?** Start with the **[Imaging Guide](docs/imaging-guide.md)** — the complete end-to-end
runbook (Ubuntu install → setup → run → post-install checklist → troubleshooting). See
**[OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md)** for subsystem deep-dives and gotchas.

## Development profile — GUI over RDP

The default `development` profile builds the engineering workstation. Beyond the dev toolchain
(`dev_tools`), the **`remote_desktop`** role makes it usable on **headless server hardware** that
users reach over RDP:

- **Installs GNOME** (`ubuntu-desktop-minimal` by default, via `dev_gnome_package`) and GDM, and
  sets the box to boot to the graphical target — so a server base with no display still gets a GUI.
- **Installs and configures xrdp** for the GNOME-over-Xorg path, with the Ubuntu 24.04 gotchas
  handled automatically: **Wayland disabled** (xrdp needs Xorg), **xrdp added to `ssl-cert`** so it
  can present the TLS cert, and a **colord/PackageKit polkit rule** so logins don't hit an auth
  prompt / black screen. RDP is served with **TLS** (`dev_rdp_use_tls`) and **rate-limited** on the
  firewall (`ufw limit 3389/tcp`).
- RDP logins go through **PAM**, so the STIG faillock/faildelay lockout applies to them too.
  Optionally restrict RDP to a group with `dev_rdp_allowed_group`.

**Hardening.** The development box is hardened by **Canonical's USG** (`usg fix disa_stig`) — the
same engine as the `ai` profile — so it needs an **Ubuntu Pro** token (handled out-of-band, exactly
like the `ai` profile; `bootstrap.sh` prompts for it). USG applies the DISA server controls; the
`desktop_hardening` role then runs **after** USG to re-assert the GUI/RDP and add the GNOME/GDM/USB
carve-outs USG doesn't cover. Because USG's DISA profile targets Ubuntu Server, **validate this on a
throwaway VM before imaging production hardware** — confirm you can still RDP in and reach a GNOME
session after the `usg fix` + reboot.

Connect any RDP client to `‹host›:3389` and log in as a local account (each ships **locked** — set
a password with `sudo passwd <user>` first). Toggles live under **`REMOTE DESKTOP`** in
`group_vars/all.yml` (`dev_install_gnome`, `dev_gnome_package`, `dev_rdp_enabled`, `dev_rdp_port`,
`dev_rdp_use_tls`, `dev_rdp_allowed_group`).

---

## AI server profile

Set `deployment_profile: ai` (or pass `PROFILE=ai` to `bootstrap.sh`) to build a
headless **Ubuntu Pro** AI server instead of the development box. **Ansible does host prep only** —
it installs Docker + the NVIDIA GPU stack, STIG-hardens the host with USG, and opens the inbound
ports your containers need. **You deploy the AI tools from your own prebuilt images + compose
files;** Ansible never renders a compose file, pulls images, or starts containers.

### Hardening: Ubuntu Security Guide (USG), not the lockdown role

The server hardens with **Canonical's USG** — `usg fix disa_stig` — the officially supported
DISA-STIG implementation that ships with Ubuntu Pro, and `usg audit` writes the compliance
report to `/var/log/stig-scan/` (same place as the development-profile scan). The box must be **Pro-attached**
first; the token is a **secret** and is handled exactly like the LUKS passphrase — supplied
out-of-band, never committed (`bootstrap.sh` prompts for it, or drop it in
`ubuntu_pro_token_file`).

Safety rails (mirroring the desktop's `disruption_high` caution):

- **No token / offline → USG self-skips** with a POA&M warning; the build never fails on a
  missing subscription.
- **`usg fix` refuses to run** unless an admin account has a real password (the DISA profile
  locks out password-less admins). It's also **stamped** so it applies once per image, not on
  every run.
- **`HARDEN=0`** (or `usg_fix_enabled: false`) → install + **audit only**. Validate on a
  throwaway VM, then flip it on.

### Host prep (`ai_stack` role) — Docker + NVIDIA only

The `ai_stack` role prepares the host so your containers can run:

- **Docker Engine** — docker-ce (floor **≥ 29.5.2**, asserted) + the compose v2 plugin, from
  Docker's official apt repo (not `docker.io`); adds `ai_stack_user` to the `docker` group. Extra
  Docker CLI plugins come from **`docker_extra_packages`** (default: **`docker-model-plugin`** +
  **`docker-sbx`**, per the 7960 baseline).
- **NVIDIA GPU stack** (`gpu_enabled: true`, default) — installs the driver (autoselected, or pin a
  branch with **`nvidia_driver_package`**, e.g. `nvidia-driver-595-server-open` for the RTX PRO 6000
  Blackwell cards) + `nvidia-container-toolkit`, and wires the `nvidia` runtime into Docker. It
  **asserts** the active driver is **≥ `nvidia_driver_min_version`** (default `595.71.05`) and the
  toolkit is **≥ `nvidia_container_toolkit_min_version`** (1.19.1) so a too-old driver fails the build
  instead of your cu129 vLLM image. A driver install needs a **reboot** first.
- **Portainer** (`portainer_enabled: true`, default) — a web UI to manage the box's containers.
  It's the management plane, not your AI stack; `ai_firewall` opens its port. It mounts the Docker
  socket (root-equivalent) — set a strong admin password on first login and restrict its port to
  admins.

It does **not** render a compose file, pull your workload images, generate secrets, or start your AI
containers — deploy your **prebuilt images + compose files** however you like once the host is prepped.

### Firewall (`ai_firewall` role) — opens your containers' ports after USG

USG enables `ufw` with **default-deny inbound**, so the ports your containers publish must be opened
explicitly or the stack is unreachable. List them in **`ai_firewall_allow_ports`** (group_vars);
the role opens them **after** USG (and ensures `ufw` is active even if USG was skipped). Each entry
takes `port`, `proto` (default `tcp`), `rule` (`allow` default, or `limit`), and `from` (source CIDR
to restrict to). Default opens Open WebUI on `80/443`; restrict the cross-node ports
(`8000/8001/5001/5432`) to the peer node's IP with `from:`. SSH is always kept (rate-limited).

### Quick start (ai server)

```bash
# Host prep + GPU + USG hardening (prompts for the Pro token, hidden):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casea1/ubuntu-stig-build/main/bootstrap.sh \
  | sudo PROFILE=ai bash

# Audit-only first pass (validate hardening before applying it):
curl -fsSL .../bootstrap.sh | sudo PROFILE=ai HARDEN=0 bash
```

Then `journalctl -u stig-build -f` to watch, collect `/var/log/stig-scan/`, **reboot** to apply USG
(and load the GPU driver), and **deploy your prebuilt AI compose stack**. Full runbook + operations:
**[OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md#ubuntu-pro-server-usg--ai-stack)** and the design notes in
**[docs/ai-server-design.md](docs/ai-server-design.md)**.

## Configuration

Everything is toggled from **[`group_vars/all.yml`](group_vars/all.yml)**:

- `wireshark_users` — local accounts allowed to capture packets
- `editor_choice` — `vscode` | `vim` | `neovim`
- `ubtu24stig_cat1` / `cat2` / `cat3` — which STIG severity tiers to apply
- `ubtu24stig_disruption_high` — apply the high-impact controls (off until validated)
- `dcsa_gui_banner` — the login banner text (DCSA Authorized Warning Banner)
- **`STIG GAP-REMEDIATION TUNABLES`** section — lockout counts, session/screensaver timeouts,
  auditd retention, firewall ports, etc. for the `tasks/*.yml` gap files (STIG-safe defaults)
- **`grub_password_pbkdf2`** — vaulted GRUB bootloader-password hash. Ships as a `CHANGEME`
  placeholder; the GRUB task self-skips until you set a real hash (see OPERATIONS.md). **Set
  this** to close the two GRUB findings.
- `dev_tools_user`, `eng_venv_path`, `powershell_version` — dev-tooling settings
- `scap_profile`, `ssg_content_version` — which compliance content to scan against

Package and VS Code extension lists live in `roles/dev_tools/defaults/main.yml`. The dev-tooling
layer is documented in [docs/dev-tools-design.md](docs/dev-tools-design.md).

### Classification banner

A persistent **top + bottom on-screen classification banner** is included (default
**UNCLASSIFIED**). This is *not* a STIG control — it's a classified-system / accreditation
requirement. **To change the level, edit `group_vars/all.yml`:**

- `classification_banner_level` — `UNCLASSIFIED` | `CUI` | `FOUO` | `CONFIDENTIAL` | `SECRET` |
  `"TOP SECRET"` | `SCI`. The level text and DoD-standard colors are defined in
  `roles/classification_banner/files/classification-banner.conf` (add your own section there for
  custom markings).
- `classification_banner_enabled` — set `false` to omit the banner entirely.
- `classification_banner_force_xorg` — the docked banner needs an **Xorg** session; `true` (default)
  forces GDM to Xorg, since Wayland ignores the dock/strut hints.

Change the value, commit/push, and re-run the build on the machine (it's idempotent — see Notes).

---

## Known issues & exceptions

This box is a **GNOME Desktop** running a STIG written for **Ubuntu Server**, plus an engineering
toolchain — so some findings are expected and documented as mission-need exceptions:

- **Desktop vs. Server:** DISA only publishes a *Server* 24.04 STIG. GNOME/GDM/graphical-target
  controls are handled or accepted as exceptions; triage the HTML report after the first scan.
- **Developer workstation:** compilers (`gcc`/`g++`/GNAT), Docker engine, and `docker`-group
  membership are required for development and are documented exceptions.
- **Network services:** `tftpd-hpa`/`isc-dhcp-server`/`dnsmasq` are installed (disabled) for
  provisioning use and will appear as scan findings.
- **Upstream role bugs (worked around):** the Lockdown v1.3.0 GNOME controls `UBTU-24-200650`
  (banner), `UBTU-24-200043` (`picture-uri`), and `UBTU-24-300025` (`logout`) write malformed
  dconf that breaks GDM; they are disabled and re-implemented correctly in `stig_harden`.

A pristine single-partition install will also flag the separate-mount controls (`/tmp`, `/var`,
`/var/log`, `/var/log/audit`, `/home`); partition manually at install time to satisfy them.

## Notes

- **Run while online, then air-gap.** The build needs internet (apt, the SSG datastream, remote
  OVAL). Collect the reports before disconnecting; `oscap` can re-scan offline afterward.
- **Reboot after hardening** for all controls (PAM, mounts, GRUB, banner) to take effect, then
  re-run the scan for accurate post-reboot results.
- Validate on a throwaway VM before imaging production hardware — the Lockdown role can make
  breaking changes.
- **Re-running is safe and idempotent.** After changing a setting or adding software, push and
  re-run the same `stig-build` command on the machine — Ansible applies only the *delta*
  (tasks already in the desired state report `ok` and do nothing; only changed/new tasks act).
  Use the detached run method (hardening restarts GDM), and reboot afterward for settings that
  need it (mounts, PAM, GRUB, the Xorg/Wayland switch).
